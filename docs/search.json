Measuring constructs such as knowledge, personality, and attitudes is fundamental to research and practice in education, psychology, and social sciences. This course aims to help students develop knowledge and skills to develop, evaluate, and use tests/measurement instruments. The course introduces principles and practices of measurement methods in educational and psychological settings. Test theories such as classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT) will be considered and fundamental concepts such as reliability, validity, and fairness will be discussed.\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 01 - Due February 20, 2025\nAssignment 02 - Coming soon\n\n\n\n\nThis website contains my assignments for EPSY 5221.
